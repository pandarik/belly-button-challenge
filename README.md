## Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
Module 14 Challenge
# Background
In this assignment, you will create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. Notably, a small handful of microbial species (referred to as operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Project Overview
# Objective: Build an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.
Data Source: Belly Button Biodiversity dataset
Features:
Explore individual sample data (e.g., OTU IDs, sample values).
Display bar charts, bubble charts, and metadata information.
Provide user-friendly interactivity.

# Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Plotly).
Make sure app.js is copied 
Run the index.html code app to launch the dashboard.


# Dashboard Components
Sample Data Visualization:
Bar chart: Top 10 OTUs found in a selected sample.
Bubble chart: Visualize OTU abundance across all samples.

Participant Metadata:
Display demographic information for the selected participant.

Dropdown Menu:
Select a sample ID to update the visualizations dynamically.

# Usage
Open the dashboard in your web browser.
Use the dropdown menu to select a sample ID.
Explore the visualizations and learn about the microbial diversity!
